I've configured your portfolio to use project-specific images. Please download the following free images and save them to `public/projects/` folder:

### 1. IoT Asthma Detection Smart Band
**Save as:** `public/projects/asthma-smart-band.jpg`

**Suggested free images:**
- Search Pexels: "smart wearable health device" or "fitness tracker"

If you have actual screenshots or photos of your projects, that would be even better! Just save them with the same filenames in the `public/projects/` folder.
